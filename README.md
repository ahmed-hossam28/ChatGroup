# ChatGroup is a multithreaded Network applicatoin for messaging between users.
This app is using the client server architecture.
I have built this console app using java sockets and it is divided into two parts the server and client.

Server Part:
Server handle the request for connection from the client 
And receive all the client messages to send it to other clients.

Client:
Client is a user that send connect to the server and can communicate with other users by sending messages and these messages are sent to the server and the server send it to other users.

To run this app:
To run this app, you must first run the server then you can run the client to make new user and you can run the client again in another terminal to another user.

Shell scripts:
You can run the app on your own but I have made some shell scripts so you can use them.
